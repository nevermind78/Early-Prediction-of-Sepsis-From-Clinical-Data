## Résumé : 
Intensive care units (ICU) are the part of hospitals where decision making is very important, complex and critical at the same time. Deciding correctly and at the right time who is the patient who needs critical care and who does not can reduce the pressure on these units, ensuring good management and allocation of resources which are both limited and very expensive. This good management will guarantee a considerable saving in costs by reducing them considerably. In fact, people whose condition is critically ill as a result of accidents, surgical complications, serious respiratory problems, infections and serious injuries can achieve death if they are not treated with technology and sophisticated equipment allowing close and constant monitoring and maintenance of bodily functions. In particular, sepsis is a major health problem and life-threatening illness that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death. Worldwide, around 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year. The costs of managing sepsis in hospitals exceed those of any other health problem. The majority of these costs relate to patients who develop sepsis while in hospital. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis improves outcomes. However, although professional critical care societies have proposed new clinical criteria that facilitate recognition of sepsis, the basic need for early detection and treatment remains unmet. It is in this context that the objective of this professional master's degree is to develop a machine learning-based model for the early and real-time prediction of sepsis from clinical data in intensive care units. This involves designing and implementing a functional predictive model to automatically identify a patient's risk of sepsis and make a positive or negative prediction of sepsis for each time window in the patient's clinical record.

## Objectives:
 Sepsis is a major public health concern with significant
morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses. Early detection
and antibiotic treatment of sepsis improve outcomes. However,
although professional critical care societies have proposed new
clinical criteria that aid sepsis recognition, the fundamental need
for early detection and treatment remains unmet. In response,
researchers have proposed algorithms for early sepsis detection,
but directly comparing such methods has not been possible because
of different patient cohorts, clinical variables and sepsis criteria,
prediction tasks, evaluation metrics, and other differences.
To address these issues, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
Challenge 2019 facilitated the development of automated,
open-source algorithms for the early detection of sepsis from clinical
data.

To do this the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process will be adopted. This process consists of 4 steps:

1. Selecting and extracting the multivariate time series data set from the database.
2. Pre-processed and cleaned up the time series into a tidy dataset by exploring the data, handling missing data, and removing noise / outliers.
3. Building a predictive model allowing to associate the time series of biomedical measurements with a real-time severity indicator (probability of mortality) by implementing several machine learning algorithms.
4. Evaluation and validation. The use of two databases provides an opportunity to validate the different predictive models that will be produced.

## The Data
Click [here](https://archive.physionet.org/users/shared/challenge-2019/) to download the complete training database (42 MB), consisting of two parts: training set A (20,336 subjects) and B (20,000 subjects).
Each training data file provides a table with measurements over time. Each column of the table provides a sequence of measurements over time (e.g., heart rate over several hours), where the header of the column describes the measurement. Each row of the table provides a collection of measurements at the same time (e.g., heart rate and oxygen level at the same time). The table is formatted in the following way:

HR |O2Sat|Temp|...|HospAdmTime|ICULOS|SepsisLabel
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
NaN|  NaN| NaN|...|        -50|     1|          0
 86|   98| NaN|...|        -50|     2|          0
 75|  NaN| NaN|...|        -50|     3|          1
 99|  100|35.5|...|        -50|     4|          1
 
 
There are 40 time-dependent variables HR, O2Sat, Temp ..., HospAdmTime, which are described here. The final column, SepsisLabel, indicates the onset of sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 definition, where 1 indicates sepsis and 0 indicates no sepsis. Entries of NaN (not a number) indicate that there was no recorded measurement of a variable at the time interval.

Note: spaces were added to this example to improve readability. They will not be present in the data files.
